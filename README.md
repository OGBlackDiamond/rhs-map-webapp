# rhs-map-webapp
The Reno High School school map has been outdated for a long time, and it causes lots of confusion when new students look to the map for guidance. My friend, Jeff, and I have created a modernized version of the map, with the goal of reducing confusion when students attempt to find their classes using a map. To take this one step further, Jeff had the idea to make a mapping program, where a student can type in their classes in order, and the program will create a visual path, displaying the optimal route to get to their classes. This will also take into account typcial hallway traffic, optionally adding bathroom breaks, and more.

We hope to provide this new feature-rich map to the school, to make everyone's life easier when it comes to finding their classes.

# why a webapp?
As the software developer in this project, I wanted to make the map readily accesable to everyone. Using a webapp would hopefully allow WCSD/RHS to impliment the webapp directly into their website, allowing people to quickly visit the app, generate their route, download it if needed, and leave without having to download anything.
